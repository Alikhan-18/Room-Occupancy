                Have you ever struggled to find a quiet study spot or an available table in a busy public space, 
                only to discover that every place is already occupied?

              In our highly connected world, understanding crowd density before arriving at a location remains a challenge. 
              To address this, weâ€™ve developed an advanced IoT solution featuring an edge device with a camera 
              that transmits images for analysis by our deep learning model. This system stores occupancy data in a database 
              and presents it through a user-friendly React-based web application..
              <br />
              With our solution, users can effortlessly access real-time occupancy stats 
              and view historical trends from the past 3 months. Administrators can also monitor specific sub-areas 
              and evaluate associated costs, enhancing decision-making and improving space management.
